What if virtual real estate in such a metaverse project cannot be parceled and sold but can only be owned collectively by the community?<br> <br> The time is ripe to envision communities that can take the concept of equity, direct democracy and put them in action. <br/><br/> In the web3 space public wallets will be the new social media profiles. We believe that wallet browsing is the new age social media profile browsing.",

A unique opportunity for visionaries, dreamers and changemakers of the metaverse to roll up their sleeves and build a meta-utopia! <br> <br> By holding a GOB NFT, you aren’t just buying an NFT, you are investing in creating a budget pool that you can access thereby allowing you to shape the project according to your vision.",

  "para3": "## WHEN \r In ancient times both creative innovation and commerce grew around gods, housed in temples, which were the centres of artistic and financial activity. Legends and myths about Gods formed part of transparent public records maintained by communities. And under such a system both art and commerce exploded and expanded. <br> <br>Thousands of years later, shamans of the Metaverse have established media of communication and expression that takes artistic and commercial innovation to uncharted frontiers.",

  "para4": "## HOW \r Taking a leaf out of their book, Gods of Block seeks to create laboratories of artistic innovation within the Metaverse: an “Artverse”. Cryptoart has the potential to put power and freedom back into the hands of the community and the creators. But this won’t happen automatically. We need committed and inclusive communities that are constantly looking at new ways of making that vision a reality.<br> <br>In GOB, we create tools that maximise individual artistic potential while allowing artists to harness the power of community to become drivers of artistic revolution on the blockchain.",
